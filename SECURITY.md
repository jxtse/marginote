# Security

## Posture

Marginote is a local-first tool. By default it binds `127.0.0.1` and serves only its own origin.

- **No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home.** Marginote never reports on you.
- **Core editing makes no outbound requests.** Discover has three user-triggered requests:
  fetching a document from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, searching repositories via
  `api.github.com`, and listing a repository's Markdown files. Install URLs are derived from the registry index rather than from the caller and the
  host is pinned, so the endpoint cannot be turned into a general-purpose fetcher for your
  machine's network position. `--no-search` keeps the curated index but disables live search;
  `--no-discover` removes the Discover surface and its requests.
- **Direct peer setup uses public STUN only after a person chooses it.** The browser contacts
  `stun.l.google.com` or `stun1.l.google.com` to discover a route. Document bytes travel over an
  encrypted WebRTC data channel directly between peers; Marginote has no TURN relay or hosted service.
  Do not choose direct peer setup if contacting public STUN is unacceptable.
- **GitHub search needs no account.** It uses the unauthenticated repository-search endpoint, which
  is rate limited to roughly ten requests a minute; results are cached and limiting is reported
  plainly. Marginote does not read or transmit `GITHUB_TOKEN` or any other credential.
- **No accounts.** Identity is a display name generated in your browser.
- **Requests are origin-checked.** Browsers permit cross-origin WebSocket upgrades with no
  preflight, and a cross-origin `GET /api/files` needs no CORS approval to be *sent*. Without a
  check, any page you had open could read and rewrite your vault. Marginote refuses a request whose
  `Origin` names an untrusted host, and checks `Host` too, which closes DNS rebinding. A *missing*
  `Origin` is allowed: that means a non-browser client (the CLI, an MCP agent, curl), which is not
  a drive-by vector.
- **Document paths are validated twice** — at the transport, and again in `Vault.getDoc`, which is
  the boundary that actually writes files and so refuses rather than trusting its caller.
- **Writes are atomic** (temp file + rename), so a reader never sees a half-written document.
- **Git snapshots are opt-in.** `--git` commits only Markdown paths Marginote changed. It does not
  include unrelated working-tree or staged changes, and it never pushes or changes remotes.

## Exposing a vault beyond your machine

`--host 0.0.0.0` and `--allow-host <name>` widen access deliberately. **There is no
authentication yet**: anyone who can reach the port can read and edit every document in the vault.
Only do this on a network you trust, or behind something that provides authentication.

## What the agent leash is, and is not

Document policy -- insert and delete budgets, propose-only, read-only, locked sections --
is enforced by the server on connections that identify themselves as agents. It is a
guardrail against the realistic failure: an agent looping, over-deleting, or wandering into
a section it was told to leave alone.

**It is not a defence against a hostile client.** A connection can simply not declare
itself an agent, and there is no authentication to tell one caller from another. Anything
that can reach the port can already write. Treat the leash as a seatbelt, not a lock.

## Where collaboration state lives

The Markdown file holds the text. Everything else -- authorship, comments, provenance,
agent policy, suggestion outcomes -- lives in a CRDT, persisted to `.marginote/state/` beside
the vault. That directory is an implementation detail: deleting it loses the collaboration
layer and nothing else, and your prose is untouched. Add it to `.gitignore` unless you
deliberately want to share attribution history. `--no-persist` turns it off entirely.

## Known limitations

- **No authentication or per-document permissions.** Access is all-or-nothing per vault.
- **No encryption at rest or in transit.** Run behind TLS if you expose it.
- **Direct peer setup reveals network metadata to public STUN.** Peers use WebRTC encryption, but
  each side and the STUN service can observe connection metadata and IP addresses.
- **Documents load eagerly at startup.** A vault with many thousands of files will use
  proportional memory.
- **Edit history is off by default.** `--history` enables replay, but disabling Yjs
  garbage collection makes document state grow with edit volume rather than with document
  size -- measured at 308x the visible text after four thousand edits. That cost lands on
  memory, on the browser's offline store, and on the payload every new client downloads.
- **`--allow-exec` runs arbitrary code as you**, in the vault directory. It is refused
  whenever the server is bound beyond loopback, never runs automatically, and is off
  unless asked for -- but an installed document you then choose to run is still code you
  are choosing to run.
- **View and comment links are enforced server-side.** View links cannot write. Comment links may
  update comment and awareness data but text edits are rejected by inspecting the CRDT update.
  These are still capability links: possession of the URL grants its role.
- **Share links are capabilities.** There are no accounts, so the link *is* the credential. Anyone
  holding it has the role baked into it. Links live in memory and die when the server stops.
- **Suggestions are advisory.** Any connected client can accept one; there is no reviewer role.
- **Registry documents are third-party content.** Marginote records where each installed file came
  from and under what licence, but does not vet it. A `CLAUDE.md` you install changes how agents
  behave in that directory — read it before you rely on it.

## Reporting

Open a GitHub issue for non-sensitive matters. For anything exploitable, please report it
privately through GitHub's security advisory flow rather than a public issue.
