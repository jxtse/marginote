 * Suggesting mode for people, the counterpart to the agent's `suggest` flag.
 *
 * Typing normally edits the document. With suggesting on, the same keystrokes become
 * proposals: insertions are marked, deletions are struck through rather than removed, and
 * nothing reaches the file until somebody accepts.
 *
 * It works by intercepting the editor's own transactions before they apply and replaying
 * them as marked CRDT operations instead. Letting the edit through and *then* marking it
 * would briefly write un-reviewed text into the document -- and, because Marginote writes
 * continuously, straight to disk.
