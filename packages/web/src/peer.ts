/**
 * Direct peer-to-peer editing, with nobody in the middle.
 *
 * This is the logical end of "your files stay yours": two people editing one document with
 * no relay, no host, and no account anywhere. A WebRTC data channel carries the same Yjs
 * sync protocol the WebSocket transport uses, so the CRDT does not know or care which way
 * the bytes arrived.
 *
 * **The honest limitations**, because this is the feature most likely to disappoint:
 *
 *  - Signalling is manual. Establishing a WebRTC connection requires exchanging an offer
 *    and an answer, and a signalling *server* is exactly the middleman this feature exists
 *    to avoid. So the two blobs are copied between people by hand, over whatever channel
 *    they already trust. Clunky, and deliberately so.
 *  - It uses public STUN only. That covers most home and office networks, but symmetric
 *    NAT needs a TURN relay, and a TURN relay is a server someone has to run and pay for.
 *    Behind such a network this will fail to connect, and it says so rather than hanging.
 *  - The channel is encrypted by WebRTC (DTLS) in transit, but the invite blob is not
 *    authenticated. Anyone who intercepts it before the answer comes back could take the
 *    other end. Exchange invites over a channel you already trust.
