# Markdown Round-trip Fixture

<!-- This comment must survive byte-for-byte. -->

This fixture includes **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`, an
[external link](https://example.com/docs?q=markdown), and a [[Wiki Link]].

> [!NOTE]
> Extended Markdown should remain source text, even when a renderer does not understand it.

## Work items

- [x] Preserve completed tasks
- [ ] Preserve open tasks
  - Preserve nested list indentation

| Feature | Expected result |
