/**
 * Persisting collaboration state.
 *
 * The Markdown file carries the text and nothing else. Everything that makes Marginote more
 * than an editor -- who wrote each span, why, the comments, the agent policy, which
 * suggestions were accepted -- lives in the CRDT, and without a home on disk all of it
 * vanished the moment the server stopped. Restarting `marginote` silently discarded every
 * comment, which is not a limitation so much as a bug with a long fuse.
 *
 * So each document gets a sidecar holding its encoded state, written beside the vault
 * rather than inside the documents themselves. The Markdown stays clean and diffable; the
 * sidecar is an implementation detail the user can delete at any time and lose only the
 * collaboration layer, never their prose.
