  marginote <directory>       Make a folder of Markdown files collaborative.
  marginote --demo             Try Marginote in a disposable sample vault.

    -v, --version         Print the installed Marginote version
    --demo                Create sample Markdown in a temporary folder, then remove it
                          when Marginote stops. No existing files are read or changed.
    --port <n>            Port to listen on (default 4321)
    --host <addr>         Bind address (default 127.0.0.1, local only)
    --allow-host <name>   Additionally trust this hostname (repeatable). Needed only
                          when deliberately exposing the vault, e.g. via a tunnel.
    --git                 Opt in to periodic git snapshots of Markdown changed by Marginote
    --no-discover         Disable the Discover tab (no outbound requests at all)
    --no-search           Keep the curated index, but disable live GitHub search
    --no-persist          Do not save collaboration state. Comments, attribution and
                          policy then last only as long as the server runs.
    --history             Retain edit history so documents can be replayed. Off by
                          default: keeping it makes document state grow with edit
                          volume rather than with document size.
    --allow-exec          Allow running fenced code blocks from documents. Off by
                          default. Runs arbitrary code as you; refused whenever the
                          server is bound beyond localhost.

  Requests are refused unless they come from loopback or an allowed host, so a web page
  you happen to have open cannot reach into your vault.

  No account, no signup, no telemetry. Core editing stays local. Discover and direct
  peer setup contact public services only when you choose those features.
