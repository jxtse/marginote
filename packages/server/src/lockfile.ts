 * A lockfile for prose.
 *
 * People fork a popular CLAUDE.md, edit it to suit their project, and never learn that the
 * original improved. Every dependency ecosystem solved this decades ago; documents never
 * did. This records what was installed and what it looked like at the time, so drift in
 * either direction can be detected and, crucially, told apart.
 *
 * Kept as a plain JSON file in the vault so it travels with the repository and is
 * reviewable in a diff, like any other lockfile.
