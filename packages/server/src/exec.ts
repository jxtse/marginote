/**
 * Running a fenced code block, and capturing what it printed back into the document.
 *
 * A runbook that has actually been run, with real output recorded beside each step, is
 * worth ten that have not. That is the entire argument for this feature, and it has to be
 * weighed against the obvious: this executes arbitrary code on the machine hosting the
 * vault.
 *
 * The safeguards are therefore not decoration:
 *
 *  - **Off unless asked for.** Requires `--allow-exec`. There is no configuration file
 *    that can turn it on by accident.
 *  - **Loopback only.** Refused outright when the server is bound beyond localhost.
 *    Marginote has no authentication, so an exposed server with execution enabled would hand
 *    a shell to anyone who could reach the port.
 *  - **Never automatic.** Blocks run only when a person asks for that specific block.
 *    Opening a document runs nothing, which means a malicious document installed from
 *    Discover cannot execute itself.
 *  - **Bounded.** Wall-clock timeout, output cap, killed process group on expiry.
