# Changelog

## Marginote — Unreleased

- Added the embedded comment agent and source↔preview navigation layer.
- Added Grill me: queued draft reviews with up to eight anchored findings and one summary.
- Default CLI launch opens ~/Documents/Marginote, seeded once on folder creation.
- Added dismissible API-key onboarding and Settings access in the editor toolbar.
- Retained the upstream Quire release history below unchanged.

## 0.1.0-beta.3 - 2026-08-30

### Positioning and Markdown fidelity
- Reframed Quire around its local, git-native source of truth and accountable AI-agent workflow
  rather than a generic "Google Docs for Markdown" comparison.
- Added an automated byte-fidelity test covering YAML frontmatter, task lists, tables, fenced code,
  Mermaid, wiki-links, footnotes, raw HTML, comments, and escaped Markdown.
- Documented the distinction between editing original `.md` files in place and cloud
  import/collaborate/export workflows.
- Published a reproducible Google Docs round-trip comparison using the same fixture, recording
  both preserved semantics and source-level changes without overstating a single test.

### Onboarding and compatibility
- Added `quire --demo`, which creates a disposable three-document vault and removes it on exit.
- Added copy-paste MCP setup for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor, including native Windows guidance.
- Added automated browser smoke coverage for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Extended the filesystem and collaboration test matrix to Windows, alongside macOS and Linux.
- Added reproducible launch artwork: a social preview, current static screenshot, compact core demo,
  and Product Hunt thumbnail, all derived from the real application recorder.

### Reliability
- Prevented a closed document connection from incorrectly marking the newly opened document offline.
- Made disposable demo cleanup handle both interactive interrupts and automated termination.
- Retried transient Windows file-lock failures without weakening atomic Markdown writes.

## 0.1.0-beta.2 - 2026-08-29

### Trust and repository hygiene
- Made git snapshots opt-in with `--git` and restricted snapshot commits to Markdown paths Quire
  changed, preserving unrelated working-tree and staged changes.
- Removed implicit `GITHUB_TOKEN` use; Discover now uses only anonymous public GitHub endpoints.
- Documented every filesystem, network, code-execution, agent, sharing, and install-time permission.
- Removed internal agent, planning, business, marketing, deployment, and product-strategy documents
  from the public repository tree.
- Replaced the demo with a current recording generated from the real application.

## 0.1.0-beta.1 - 2026-08-28

First release. Point Quire at a folder of Markdown and it becomes a live multiplayer
workspace where AI agents are collaborators you can watch, not processes that rewrite your
files behind your back.

### Release readiness
- Added deterministic polling for watcher-based tests and immediate WebSocket termination
  during room teardown, eliminating platform-specific hangs without changing production
  watcher behavior.
- Added `quire --version` and expanded the publishability check to verify executable bits,
  version output, licence and binary metadata, bundle startup, shebangs, and dependency closure.
- Split the editor, collaboration runtime, and Markdown parser into stable browser chunks;
  Mermaid remains lazy-loaded only when a document contains a diagram.
- Reconciled security, licensing, package, release, and launch documentation with the code
  that is actually shipped.
- Added grouped monthly Dependabot updates for npm dependencies and GitHub Actions.
- Updated GitHub's checkout and Node setup actions to their Node 24-based major releases.
- Upgraded the test runner to patched Vitest 4.1 releases; both the complete and
  production-only npm dependency audits report zero known vulnerabilities.

### Editing
- Real-time co-editing over plain `.md` files, with the filesystem as the source of truth.
  External edits — another editor, `git pull` — merge as CRDT deltas rather than overwrites.
- Presence, remote cursors, offline editing via IndexedDB, and reconnection.
- Comments anchored to text ranges that survive concurrent edits; threads whose anchor is
  deleted are flagged rather than dropped.
- Suggesting mode for people, and an enforced comment-only role for reviewers.
- Wiki-links with backlinks, ripgrep-backed search, Mermaid, git snapshots.

### Agents
- MCP endpoint with 17 tools. Agents join the same CRDT session as humans: visible cursor,
  attributed spans, separately revertable work.
- Agent leashes — insert and delete budgets, propose-only, read-only, sections locked by
  heading — enforced where writes land rather than requested in a prompt.
- Politeness: an agent yields to a human working in the same passage, turning its edit into
  a suggestion instead of typing over them.
- Provenance: every span records who, which model, which tool, and the instruction behind
  it. `why_does_this_exist` answers that for any passage.

### Sharing
- Capability links with view / comment / edit roles, all enforced server-side.
- Review requests: a link carrying a brief, openable with no account and no install.
- Provenance receipts: a self-contained page reporting what a document is made of, with the
  replay embedded.

### Discover
- A curated index of widely-used Markdown, plus live GitHub search. The registry is an
  index, not a host: files are fetched from their own repositories, with provenance
  recorded and drift from upstream tracked in `quire.lock`.

### Appearance
- Sixteen themes, including both classics and published palettes used at their real values.
- Text-bearing roles are contrast-corrected per theme at runtime: published palettes are
  built for syntax highlighting, where the lowest greys are comments nobody reads, and
  mapping them straight onto prose left secondary text illegible in most of them.
- Typography controls for prose and editor faces, size, leading and measure, plus a focus
  mode. All display-only — none of it changes a byte of the file.

### Notable defaults
- Binds `127.0.0.1`, refuses cross-origin requests, no telemetry, no accounts.
- Edit history is **off** (`--history`): retaining it makes state grow with edit volume.
- Code execution is **off** (`--allow-exec`) and refused whenever the server is not on
  loopback.
- Collaboration state persists in `.quire/state/` so it survives a restart.
